\textit{Knowledge is power}, and when certain people hold the keys to information, this leads to abuse or an \textbf{uneven sharing} of data.
Examples of such players could be:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Publishing houses.
	\item Big pharma, who can charge as they please.
	\item Companies with monopolies on technology.
	\item Goverments that don't want knowledge in the hands of foreign players.
\end{itemize}

Free sharing of knowledge will lead to a more competitive economy in the long run. It could also encourage shifts market in favor of those players with the most experience in the application of said knowledge. \index{Patents!Releasing}
\textit{Just because you have the knowledge, means you can apply it}.

\textbf{Examples} of such cases:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Tesla released their patents on electric charging.
	\item Commercial software being offered as service. (Adobe Suite, Fusion 360)
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Pleads} \index{Prison!Pleads}
The most used option for justice systems that are overloaded with cases. About \textbf{95\% of cases in the US} are solved through pleads. \index{United States!Prison!Pleads}

\subsubsection{People requesting pleads}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Innocent people with no resources to have a long legal battle
    \item Guilty people who can get a better deal (shorter sentences, or walking away)
\end{itemize}


\subsection{Unsolved cases} \index{Prison!Unsolved cases}

Once a person has been prosecuted, the case is consider closed and goes to the backlog. Whether the person is guilty is not relevant.

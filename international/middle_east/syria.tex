\subsection{Rojava}

Kurds in the North were left alone (Bashar Alassad focused on the the cities from the west), so they started defending their turf. (2014)

The kurd fighters were the most effective at fighting ISIS

The organization of this region was provided by the YPG political party (which has historically supported the PKK, a recognized terrorist organization which has attacked cities in Turkey)

After the Kurds started making progress in the north of Syria, United States provided military support to the forces to defeat ISIS.

Now that ISIS is gone with the country still divided, the Syrian Democratic Forces stablished a new territory, of independent governance from Syria, named Rojava. US has stopped helping the SDF, and now Turkey is attacking Rojava, as its goverment (YPG) because:
\begin{itemize}
    \item YPG is claiming part of Turkey's territorry as theirs
    \item YPG has been a supporter of the PKK
    \item US can't intervene in favor of the Kurds, as Turkey is its ally.
\end{itemize}

Rojava prooved to be a very \textbf{promising young democracy}  in the middle east
\begin{itemize}
    \item Gave equal represresentation for men and women in goverment and military
    \item Functional elections
    \item The kurds, after the war, have accepted people from different faction in their territories.
\end{itemize}

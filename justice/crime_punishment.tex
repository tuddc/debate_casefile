\section{Crime and punishment} \index{Crime}

Punishment has certain goals:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Prevention
	\item Deterrance
	\item Rehabilitation
	\item Retribution
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Prevention} \index{Crime!Prevention}
We lock people who're a danger to society to stop them from doing it again.

However, harder punisments \textbf{don't lead} to larger prevention. Once a person has been locked up, there's little reason for them to commit the same crime after their time is up.


\subsection{Deterrance} \index{Crime!Deterrance}
To stop those people who have yet to commit crimes. The decision of being a criminal can be objectivley weighed inside the mind of \textbf{rational potential criminals}.

\begin{itemize}
	\item "If I steal something, a \$100 fine stop me from stealing \$1"
	\subitem (Harsher punishment leads to larger deterrance)
	\item "How likely am I to be caught?"
	\subitem (For those recurring criminals this is an important factor)
	\item This doesn't stop impulsive criminals from commiting crimes.
\end{itemize}

Whether the punishments are too hard,  (Philipines' death penalty to all drug users) they are effective at \textbf{changing the mind} of people on the dangers of being associated with these crimes.

				
					
	
		Rehabilitation
			change
				Take them out of the enviorment that lead them to be criminals, so that they can change

		Retribution
			Justice from the victims
				"If you did something wrong, something should be done to you"
				"Restore the balance of the society which you have done wrong to"
			Should the justice system strive for higher retribution
				[Principal argument] : Balance of rights. Certain rights are infinged > they take your freedom > they should repay you


	Goals for the justice system
		Fairness
			"Should poor and rich be punished equally?"
			"Should hate crimes be punished heavily?"


	Tradeoffs between goals
		In debates you will have to compare say, deterrance is more important than retribution
			"higher deterrence harms the criminals by not letting them rehailitate, thus the benefits from higher retribution is not justified"

	Find the right balance for justice
		Reoffending criminals
			In many countries (UK, US, etc), these people can't become good working memebers of society.
				Criminals not know what society is like
				Society doesn't want them (stigmatization)
			There's thing we can do:
				Training, accomodation, education for criminals
				This doesn't work everywhere		
			
			This can only work in certain societies
				US, Latam societies have harsher critisim of criminals

				Labels are important
					"Rapists", "Perpetrators" makes them sound worse
					Punishment in "2 years" doesn't sound harsh, as in "700 days"

				If people rescind in crime you get BACKLASH
					This backlash can lead to worse society state

	Prison societies
		Echochambers within prisons
			In order to survive prison time, you enter into gang society
				Gang societies prevent you from getting back into society

			More guardds doensnt ensure the fight
				not enough guardds
				guards take bribes
					still have drug smuggling

		Private vs public prisons
			US, UK and AUS have Private

			This has competition to reduce re-offend rate

			Private = innovate with little accountability. Some have worse violence
				The worst prisons in the worse are Private.
			
			Public = are acccountable, though less effective

			Private prisons have political capital
				California blocked legislation that would limit number of prisoners.


	Data on types of prisons
		Scandinavian
			Lowest resindance
			Maximum 21 years prison sentence
				They can still add additional sentences afterwards

				Some soceiteies consider 

			benefits are exclusive to norewgians

			Population is increasing
				Not enough space
				renting space in the netherlands

		Latam prisons
			Overcapacity
				320% capacity in El Salvador
				Honduras 7000 are encarcerated and only 1000 are released
					This leads to bad services
					If a fire breaks, a lot of people die

			Encarcerated
				Due to drug crimes. Most of them are due to low level crimes

			Rehabilitation is non-existen

			Society has a harsh view on criminals
				The media portray criminals as violent, animalistic beings

				People are put into detention before any form of trials
					60 ~ 70 on panama, vs 20% in US

					Most people spend more time waiting for trail than the actual punishment

			Change is overall too slow, as the justice systems are overwhelmed

		US prisons
			5% of world Population, but 25% of prisoners are in US
				Minimum sentences and minor drug sentences
					Drug posession + owning a firearm even if not criminally linked together, get punished as if they were linked

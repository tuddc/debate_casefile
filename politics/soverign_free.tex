\section{Soverign free territories} \index{Soverignity!Free territories}

Nations can decide which territory their laws can apply.

\subsection{Embassies}
National police can't enter, laws of the host don't apply (Except some special cases like the UN HQ in USA).

Embassis aren't soverign territory. Host country can close them if they repeatedly violate the host's laws.

These are ultimately, \textbf{``special areas with special laws''}


\subsection{Free ports}

\begin{itemize}
	\item These ports are used to move art. \index{Art!Tax Evasion}. This art is used as a way of collecting wealth by shaddy buisness.
\end{itemize}

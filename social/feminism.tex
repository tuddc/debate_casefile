\subsection{Privilege} \index{Privilege!Feminism}

It's often overlooked that the fight that feminism gives in the public spheres are usually fights for urban populations, which aren't the people that need the most help.

This lack of impact that first world feminism is reasons to forget that \textbf{feminism is about women who fight}. Those who day in and day out face from series of micro-agressions to structural blockades to their personal and profesional development.

\subsection{Abuse} \index{Abuse!Feminism}

Unbalanced systems of power lead to all forms of abuse.
\begin{itemize}
	\item The abuser does as they please
	\item There's little chance of reprimands
	\item Abusers are \textbf{typically} white, straight men.
\end{itemize}


\subsubsection{Not coming forward}

\begin{itemize}
	\item Because at the time it wasn't clear to the victim that abuse had taken place.
	\subitem \textit{He was my friend, and didn't hit me. Was it rape?}
	\item For fear to being repressed
	\subitem \textit{People won't believe me}
	\subitem \textit{I won't get another job after being labeled `troublesome'}
	\subitem \textit{I might be abused again}
	\item Because public response might minimize the case, and \textbf{shift the blame}.
	\subitem \textit{`You knew what/who you were getting into'}
	\subitem \textit{`You slept with your boss, got a promotion, and now you're coming forward'}
\end{itemize}
